# 18/6/2024: the Yelp Dataset (updated on 31/7/2024)
Yelp is a platform for users to find, review, and recommend businesses in different categories (e.g. food, shopping, entertainment, etc.) across 8 metropolitan areas in the USA and Canada. This [dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset) is originally used for the Yelp Challenge and it is open for academic research.

## Insights
1. **Comprehensive User and Business Profiles**: The dataset allows for the creation of detailed user and business profiles, enriched by a variety of attributes such as geographical location and specific business characteristics. This comprehensive data enables more nuanced and context-aware recommendations tailored to individual user preferences and behaviors.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Review texts can be analyzed to gauge user sentiment, improving recommendation relevance.
3. **Collaborative Filtering**: Supports collaborative filtering techniques with extensive user-business interaction data.
4. **Temporal Analysis**: Check-in data can be used to understand temporal patterns, enhancing time-sensitive recommendations.
5. **Visual Content**: Photos can improve the user experience by providing visual recommendations.
6. **Weighted Score**: The importance of each review can be weighted using the user's review history, potentially improving the accuracy of recommendations by considering the credibility and experience of reviewers.

## [Dataset Example on Github](https://github.com/Yelp/dataset-examples)
- It shows different use cases of the Yelp Dataset. They are "Category Predictor" (given some text, predict likely categories), "Review Autopilot" (use a markov chain to finish a review, ~auto predict text outcome), "Positive Category Words" (generates positivity score for words either globally or per-category, ~ sentiment analysis).
- The set up is using the mjrob's runner (run the code in the docker container). It is based on Hadoop. We can choose either local or cloud environment.
  - Local: if you have access to your own hadoop cluster, check out the mrjob docs for instructions on how to set this up
  - Cloud: Amazon EMR

We will use Flask to build the backend server. To run the backend server (make sure you are in the pipenv shell), you can use the following command:
```bash
cd src/backend
pipenv shell
python app.py
```

The backend server will be running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. You can access the server using this URL.
